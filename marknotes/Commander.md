Some very useful commands that are useful in Jekyll

*`jekyll new_folder`*: create a jekeyll folder that store all the necessary files which build the website(like CSS, post
layout or other information)

*`bundle exec jekyll serve`*: run the serve of github page(like `jekyll serve 4000`)

*`bundle update`*": update the Jekyll, so that our local effect is the same as the server, since if the Github changes
style by using new Jekyll version, our local effects is different is not updated to the newest version.
